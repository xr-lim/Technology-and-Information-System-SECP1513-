<summary>PC Assemble</summary>
During the PC assemble, I have learnt how to assemble and dissemble a PC. Also, I can recognize some part of the PC which every part is an important constitute to the feasibility of the computer. The activity was engaging too as a small competition was held to compete which group could assemble back the PC faster and the fastest group got the prize. I was so happy my group was the fastest of that session.

I think the structure and organization of Clarity Techworks sparked my excitement to step into the ICT industry in the future. I love the positive vibes between co-workers and managers. The talk is also insightful as the employee of Clarity Techworks have introduced their role and position details in the organization including their routine, challenges, the tools they use in their work etc. Overall, it's an honor to attend this virtual talk as it inspired me to become more dedicated and motivated role in ICT in the future.

A visit to UTM Digital and attending the virtual talk has benefits the students to gain more knowledge regarding the infrastructure of IT and the built system in a successful and organized company. It was a pleasure to visit UTMDigital as it exposed the real environment of being a tech developer, manager, IT technician, etc. I think it's good to have the virtual talk before physically visiting the office as detailed explanations were briefed during the virtual talk and students are more inclined to explore the office during the visit.

The talk was given by Ms Qistina, which were a UTM alumni and now working at Credence(TM subsidiary). The most impressive of her talks is the experience she shared with us during her uni life. She gave a lot of advice to university students like us. For instance, she mentioned that she faced a lot of challenges during her internship but due to her grit and determination, her superior saw potential in her and eventually offered a job for her in Credence. It's very inspirational to be such a dedicated and persevering person like her. Other than that, she also shared about the role of data analyst andit's importance which gave me an insight into the importance of data.
